---

## Get Started

**Reqvire** is the lightweight Git-native **Requirements As Code** framework that transforms how modern engineering teams build software. Seamlessly blending system modeling, requirements management, and AI-assisted development. Reqvire empowers teams to deliver better products faster with complete traceability and intelligent automation.

Experience the future of development where your requirements live alongside your code, evolve with your project, and unlock the full potential of AI-powered engineeringâ€”from intelligent requirement synthesis to automated code generationâ€”all within your familiar Git workflow.

Reqvire unlocks:
  - ðŸš€ Requirements as Code: Transform requirements from static documents into living, version-controlled assets that evolve with your codebase
  - âš¡ Effortless Integration: Plug seamlessly into your existing workflow with Git branches, pull requests, and CI/CD pipelinesâ€”no disruption, just enhancement
  - ðŸ¤– Smart Automation: Reqvire handles diagram generation, traceability matrices, and impact analysis automaticallyâ€”your requirements become high-quality context for AI tools
  - ðŸ§  AI-Ready Architecture: Optimal context that enables AI assisted requirements management and assisted codingâ€”AI understands what needs to be built, where to make changes, and how everything connects
